# AssortedLabview

Here are a few Labview programs I have written to help with in-lab work. Currently, there are three: 

1) Molecule Evap
2) Annealing
3) DelayProject

Each has its own readme file with details about the purpose of the program and its functionality, as well as how it is used with in-lab equipment.
